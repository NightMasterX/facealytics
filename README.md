## Introduction

Facealytics is a project that leverages deep learning techniques to classify skin diseases. It uses a pre-trained VGG19 model and a dataset of skin disease images to train a model for disease classification.

## Features

- Pre-trained VGG19 model for feature extraction.
- Skin disease classification with high accuracy.
- A user interface for making predictions on skin disease images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facealytics.git
